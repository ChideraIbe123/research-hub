Robust object detection is critical for autonomous driving and mobile robotics. Despite the advancements in object detection transformers (DETRs), their robustness against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of DETR model and its variants under both white-box and black-box attacks. We propose a novel untargeted attack designed specifically for DETR. Microsoft’s ‘coco’ system is based on the kitti vision benchmark suite. It is designed to recognize common objects in context. It can be used to identify cats, dogs, and other objects in a variety of situations.
