Collaborative filtering algorithms have garnered significant attention for their efficiency and interpretability. Traditional collaborative filtering approaches face numerous challenges when integrated into large-scale LLM-based systems, including high computational costs, severe data sparsity, cold start problems, and lack of scalability. We propose several optimization strategies, including matrix factorization, approximate nearest neighbor search, and parallel computing. Zhang W, Huang J, Wang R, et al.
