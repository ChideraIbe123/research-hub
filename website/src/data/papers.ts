    abstract: `The non-Markovian dynamics of an open quantum system can be rigorously derived using the Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach. Although this formalism is exact, practical numerical implementations often require compromises. The time-convolutionless (TCL) master equation offers an exact framework, yet its application typically relies on a perturbative expansion of both the time forward and time backward state propagators. Due to the significant computational effort involved - and the scarcity of analytical solutions for most open quantum systems - the fourth-order perturbative TCL generator (TCL4) has only been benchmarked on a limited range of systems and parameter spaces. Recent advancements, however, have made the computation of TCL4 faster and more accessible. In this paper, we benchmark the TCL4 master equation against numerically exact methods for the biased spin-boson model. We focus on the regime near critical bath coupling where perturbative master equations are expected to become inaccurate. Our findings reveal that the TCL4 approach is most reliable at low temperature and more efficient than the numerical exact methods. This study aims to delineate the conditions under which the TCL4 perturbative master equation enhances the accuracy of the TCL2.`,
    summary: `Researchers used the Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach to rigorously derive non-Markovian dynamics for an open quantum system. The TCL4 master equation was benchmarked against numerically exact methods, including the biased spin-boson model, with a focus on the regime near critical bath coupling where perturbative master equations are expected to become inaccurate. Findings revealed that TCL4 is most reliable at low temperatures and more efficient than the numerical exact methods. A fast numerical implementation of TCL423 was developed, reducing the triple integral to a single integration. The researchers found that the domain of usability for TCL4's perturbative master equation depends on the coupling strength to the bath, with spectral density in Eqn. 5 with fDrude causing real correlation functions to become negative at early times at low temperatures. TCL generators were derived explicitly from Eqn. 8 using the Nakajima-Zwanzig technique, and a back-order propagator was used to transfer time nonlocality in the memory kernel of the system to the bath function. Benchmarking explored variations in both bath temperature and system bias, with TCL4 showing excellent consistency with TEMPO at low temperatures but losing reliability at high temperatures. The researchers concluded that TCL4 delivers consistent computational efficiency across all regimes, offering a viable alternative to exact methods where they are computationally prohibitive.`,
