It  defines Army personnel recovery and \\ndiscusses the foundations of personnel recovery. It explains Army personnel recovery \\ncomponents and concludes with the Army personnel recovery proficiencies. \\nFOUNDATIONS \\n1-1. Army personnel recovery is the military efforts taken to prepare for and execute the recovery \\nand reintegration of isolated personnel.  Army forces work together with Department of Defense (DOD) \\nand other unified action partners to recover individuals and groups who become isolated. Isolation refers to \\npersons being separated from their unit or in a situation where they must survive, evade, resist, or escape. \\nIn addition, Army forces support the recovery of othe r persons designated by the President or the Secretary \\nof Defense. Preserving the life and well-being of persons working for the Army, or any DOD organization, \\nis one of the highest priorities of the United States  Government. The personnel recovery mission includes \\npreparing Soldiers, other Service members, Army civ ilians, and contractors in danger of isolation while \\nparticipating in any activity or mission sponsored by the United States.  \\n1-2. Army professionals have moral and legal responsib ilities to train, educate, coordinate, and recover \\nisolated members of the Army (and other persons as designated) who are operating in the area of operations'),\n",

Army professionals have moral and legal responsib ilities to train, educate, coordinate, and recover \\nisolated members of the Army (and other persons as designated) who are operating in the area of operations \\n(AO) or accompanying Army or unified forces. It is a principle embedded in the Army’s Warrior Ethos and \\nthe Soldier’s Creed (see ADP 1). \\n1-3. Unified land operations is the Army’s warfightin g doctrine and the Army’s contribution to unified \\naction. It describes how the Army seizes, retains, and exploits the initiative to gain and maintain a position \\nof relative advantage (see ADRP 3-0). Army forces execute unified land operations through the elements of \\ndecisive action: offensive, defensive, and stability or defense support of civil authorities’ (DSCA’s) tasks. \\nWithin all these elements, alone or in any combination, Army personnel recovery doctrine guides Army \\nforces to adapt to conditions and successfully accomplish personnel recovery missions.  \\nORGANIZATIONS \\n1-4. Army forces conduct operations as part of a joint force and together with other Service and \\ngovernment partners. The joint force cooperates and coordinates with unified action partners. Army forces \\nuse established organizational structures coordinated with joint, other Service, and United States \\nGovernment (USG) entities. Each Service has its own personnel recovery policy, doctrine, equipment,'),\n",

Paragraphs 1-5 through 1-20 give an overview of organizational structures for \\npersonnel recovery. JP 3-50 contains a detailed discussion of personnel recovery organizational structures. \\nJOINT PERSONNEL RECOVERY ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE \\n1-5. DODD 3002.01 assigns DOD responsibilities for personnel recovery. It identifies the Under \\nSecretary of Defense for Policy as responsible for development of national personnel recovery policy, \\nstrategy, and operational oversight, through the Deputy Under Secretary of Defe nse for Policy Integration \\nand Chief of Staff and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel \\nAffairs. The United States (U.S.) Air Force is the DOD executive agent for personnel recovery (other than \\npolicy). The Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) is the office of primary responsibility. The JPRA is \\na chairman controlled activity, aligned under the Joint Staff Directorate for Joint Force Development. The \\nJPRA provides joint guidance, develops and conducts joint training, provides support to deployed forces, \\ncollects joint lessons learned, and supports joint policy and doctrine development. The JPRA supports \\noperational implementation of joint personnel recovery policy.'),\n",

Figure 1-1 depicts the personnel recovery architecture in a combatant command organized \\nby function. \\nFigure 1-1. Personnel recovery organization at the joint force level \\nJOINT PERSONNEL RECOVERY CENTER \\n1-7. Each combatant commander establishes a joint pers onnel recovery center (JPRC). The JPRC plans, \\nmonitors, and coordinates personnel recovery for the command. It coordinates with joint and Service \\ncomponent staffs, DOD agencies, and other USG agencies and unified action partners to accomplish its \\nmission. The center’s composition varies. A JPRC is typically composed of senior leadership (director and \\ndeputy), shift duty officers, noncommissioned officers, and subject matter experts in related disciplines. \\nThese individuals act as liaisons to and from external organizations. The JPRC serves as the joint force \\ncommander’s primary coordination center for assisting other nations or appropriate civilian entities. \\nJP 3-50 details the responsibilities of the JPRC. \\nPERSONNEL RECOVERY COORDINATION SECTIONS \\n1-8.

The Marine Corps, \\nNavy, Air Force, and Coast Guard have long familiarity with personnel recovery because the nature of their \\noperations often requires them to recover the crews of  ships and aircraft. Service doctrine and practice are \\napplicable for permissive environments, resultin g from accidents or disaster, and nonpermissive \\nenvironments in combat or unfriendly situations. The joint force commander can task subordinates with \\npersonnel recovery missions. All Service components staff, equip, and train personnel recovery sections for \\n24-hour operations. \\nMarine Corps \\n1-11. Marine Corps personnel recovery operations follow a tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel \\n(known as TRAP) concept.

The three entities most concerned with applying personnel recovery doctrinal principles are the \\ncommander and staff, unit or recovery force, and isolated persons.

They periodically revise \\nit as conditions change. Subordinate leaders build and develop their personnel recovery guidance based on \\nthat of the higher headquarters. \\nProduce Isolated Soldier Guidance Based on the Personnel Recovery Guidance \\n1-25. The commander and staff personnel recovery focal group produce isolated Soldier guidance (ISG) \\nbased on the personnel recovery guidance. ISG is more developed and refined than the commander’s \\npersonnel recovery guidance. It may exist for an AO , but leaders at all echelon s force tailor the ISG for \\neach specific mission within the AO. \\nMaintain Personnel Accountability at All Times \\n1-26. The commander and staff personnel recovery focal group maintain personnel accountability at all \\ntimes. Accurate accountability and re porting narrow the focus of search operations and save time and \\nresources.

The commander and staff personnel recovery focal group identifies and provides guidance and tasks \\nto the recovery force. The recovery force may be designated in the execution document and given a \\npersonnel recovery mission (the force will execute at a set time) or an on-order mission (the force will \\nexecute at a time to be determined). Commanders sometimes give a be-prepared mission to a designated \\nrecovery force. A unit with a be-prepared mission trai ns, obtains resources, and remains ready to execute \\nthe mission. All three instances require guidance and preparation. \\nExercise Mission Command of Personnel Recovery Tasks \\n1-28. Commanders—supported by their staffs—exercise mission command of personnel recovery tasks: \\nreport, locate, support, recover, and reintegrate. This means that commanders are familiar with the tasks \\nand have adequately resourced the staff to conduct operations.'),\n",

The second personnel recovery focal group is the unit or recovery force. The immediate or deliberate \\nrecovery of isolated Soldiers or others normally falls to the responsibility of the person’s unit of assignment \\nas designated in the operation plan (OPLAN) or operation order (OPORD). Units generally execute an \\nimmediate recovery of any isolated unit member when practical . This is especially important for isolation \\ncaused by enemy action where the frie ndly force can conduct the recovery before the enemy knows of the \\nisolation. If an immediate recovery is not possible, that unit or another designated recovery force may \\nconduct a directed recovery mission. The unit or other designated recovery force, as a personnel recovery \\nfocal group, integrates several responsibilities within the personnel recovery components. \\nReceive the Mission and Conduct the Operations Process  \\n1-30. The unit or recovery force receives the mission and conducts the operations process. As time is \\ncritical in personnel recovery, this may be an abbreviated process based on guidance from higher \\nheadquarters where mission analysis  leads to a rapid (or directed) course of action (COA) development, \\nCOA analysis and approval, and production of the order. \\nExecute the Order  \\n1-31.

The unit or recovery force executes the order. Execution includes an update on the friendly and \\nenemy situation or environmental h azard, marshalling the required unit resources and maneuvering to the \\nlocation of the isolated person. Th e recovery force may have to figh t for the recovery and must come \\nprepared for combat. In the case of isolation by an environmental hazard, such as a chemical spill or \\nbiological contamination, the force must prepare for contingencies, including the need for decontamination \\nor lifesaving medical treatment. \\nDeliver the Isolated Person or Group to Postisolation Reintegration  \\n1-32. The unit or recovery force delivers the isolated pe rson or group to reintegration. Postisolation \\nreintegration activities follow successful recovery of  the isolated person or group. Depending on the \\ncircumstances of and the length of time a recovered pe rson was isolated or in the control of the enemy, \\nreintegration may be a short local activity requiring little planning or a long and involved process.

The primary task of an isolated person is to try to regain contact with friendly forces as soon as \\npossible. When all three personnel recovery focal groups base their actions on the ISG, they facilitate the \\ncoordination and synchronization of recovery efforts. Adherence to the ISG provides some predictability to \\nthe isolated person or group that their actions will be more easily monitored, thus making recovery more \\ncertain. \\nPERSONNEL RECOVERY OPTIONS \\n1-34. Joint personnel recovery doctrine describes three personnel recovery options: military, diplomatic, \\nand civil. The only option commanders can select is th e military option; the other two are at the USG or \\ncitizen level. \\nMilitary Option \\n1-35. In most cases, a unit conducts a recovery maki ng full use of the in-pl ace personnel recovery \\ncapabilities and the designated recovery forces.

Successful units train and equip all individuals to self-recover in the event recovery forces cannot \\nexecute other recovery methods due to weather, threat, or operational necessity. Isolated personnel may \\nhave the most complete knowledge of their situation and use individual Soldier skills to evade enemy \\nforces, awaiting the right time to return to friendly control. An unassisted recovery depends on the \\ncondition of the Soldiers and the situation at the lo cation where they are isolat ed. A wounded, injured, \\nexhausted, or disoriented Soldier, one endangered by enemy forces, or one without the proper equipment, \\nmay be unable to self-recover. If possible, isolated individuals communicate if they cannot conduct \\nunassisted recovery to alert the responsible command to begin planning for an immediate, deliberate, or \\nexternal supported recovery. \\nImmediate Recovery \\n1-37. An isolated person’s unit is often in the best position to receive the report, locate the person, and \\nexecute recovery. Unit leadership—knowing the mission  and Soldier’s tasks—has the best idea of the \\nSoldier’s whereabouts.

Immediate recovery assumes \\nthat the tactical situation permits a recovery with the forces at hand, and those forces have a clear enough \\nunderstanding of the situation to accomplish the mission.  It also assumes that su ccessful recovery occurs \\nwithout excessive casualties to the recovery force, without unduly imperiling the isolated person, and \\nwithout endangering the unit’s overall mission. \\nDeliberate Recovery \\n1-38. Deliberate personnel recovery is appropriate when an immediate recovery was unsuccessful or not \\nattempted due to the threat, asset availability, current operations, or isolated personnel situation. Such a \\nsituation can arise when the enemy has a preponde rance of combat power or when environmental \\nconditions such as weather, contamination, or flooding prevent immediate recovery operations. \\nCommanders conduct deliberate personnel recovery like any other deliberate operation, using the military \\ndecisionmaking process and appropriate preparation. The operation can be a mission specifically to recover \\nan isolated person or a specified or implied task in another mission. \\nExternal Supported Recovery \\n1-39.

When a recovery mission exceeds the capabilities of Army forces, they may request external support \\nfrom Service, joint, or multinational forces. When Army forces assist outside entities in personnel recovery, \\nit is external support. In addition to direct military support, host-nation (HN) security forces (military, \\nparamilitary, and national police) and multinational forces often support recovery operations. This external \\nsupport can include direct participation or indirect support in the recovery mission. Examples of indirect \\nsupport are intelligence; air, ground, and water tr ansport; reconnaissance and surveillance; medical \\nevacuation and medical treatment facilities; fires; protection; and communications. At echelons above \\nbrigade, the command’s PRCS coordinates external support with its approp riate counterparts. To facilitate \\nthe external support entity’s activities, Army headquarters and forces provide necessary information, which \\nmay include information entered on DD Form 1833 (Isolated Personnel Report [ISOPREP]) and ISG.

At a \\nminimum, this assistance permits U.S. recovery forces access to ground and water or overflight rights to the \\nsovereign territory. Direct government-to-government support involving several governments complicates \\na recovery effort. \\n1-42. Certain situations require an indirect approach. Coordination sometimes occurs through clandestine \\ncontacts by American Embassy personnel in the host country or by meetings between envoys of affected \\ncountries in other locations. The result of such contacts may be full and open support to recovery efforts or \\npermission to conduct the operations—including negotiations for release—without attracting public notice. \\n1-43.

However, know ing that persons  have become \\nisolated—especially Army civilians, contractor pers onnel authorized to accomp any the force (CAAF), or \\nother designated persons—sometimes is challenging.

In a joint operations area, the theater army headquarters expects a status report—such as dead, \\ncaptured, held hostage, missing, or whereabouts unknown—within four hours in the approved casualty \\nreport format (see FM 6-99). At each echelon above brigade headquarters, the commanders expect an \\nimmediate report. In an area with a high risk of isolation, the commander may direct subordinate \\norganizations to report probable isolating events, even though the opportunity for a false positive is high. \\nExpending command resources to find someone who is not actually isolated may seem tactically wasteful, \\nbut it communicates and reinforces a powerful message to the command—no unaccounted person will be \\nabandoned.

Site exploitation supports the locate task. Systematic examination of the last known location of an \\nisolated person or group offers the opportunity to gather information and material that may lead to finding \\nthose isolated or determining what happened to them . Isolated persons leave vi sible and invisible evidence \\nof their presence. They abandon equipment, scratch names and dates, write notes, or leave fingerprints, \\nhair, or body fluids. These clues can lead to forensic analysis and identification.

Communication is the responsibility of all three personnel recovery focal groups. Integrated \\ninformation systems and knowledge management procedures used to move knowledge from one \\nheadquarters to another headquarters and one individual to another individual are important components in \\nsuccessful personnel recovery. The planning, preparation, and execution of information exchange permits \\nsharing necessary information with the proper headquarters, groups, and individuals.

Generally, a \\ncommand’s ability to improve situational awareness about an isolated person or group directly correlates to \\na positive outcome of an isolating event. \\n1-79.

However, that \\ndoes not relieve those individuals of the responsibility to know how to communicate with these \\norganizations. Their knowledge results directly from their preparation. Knowledge of how to use \\ncommunications equipment is a basic Soldier skill. Knowledge of, and the ability to use, personnel \\nrecovery related equipment such as a distress beacon is the key to  a potential recovery. Low-tech \\ncommunications systems augment electronic systems. Effective units train each Soldier in the use of visual \\nsignals such as colored panels, reflective mirrors, or signal fires. \\nNAVIGATE \\n1-80. Both personnel and units require strong navigational skills.

In personnel recovery operations, the intent of guidance at any level of command is to communicate \\nhow organizations or individuals should act in the absence of specific instructions.

Personnel recovery guidance, ISG, \\nand evasion plans of action are also for civilians and CAAF. Because the isolated person may include \\nArmy civilians, and CAAF, Army leaders and staff must develop a communications program to inform \\nthese individuals. Civilian and contractor members of Army organizations need the guidance and \\npreparation necessary for their safety, especially the ISG that enables them to contribute to prevention, \\npreparation, and self-recovery if they become isolated. When working with third-country national CAAF or \\nother designated persons (for example, local national), culture and language complicate this format. \\n3-14.

The commander gives guidance for developing ISG during initial \\nplanning. Tactical commanders establish ISG for operations  in any area with a risk of isolation. Effective \\nguidance addresses the challenges of isolation within a unit’s AO. It is concrete enough for Soldiers to \\nimplement. ISG applies to the entire command since the uncertainty and complexity of military operations \\nexpose everyone to risk of isolation, regardless of rank. ISG anticipates the potential situation.

Soldiers need objective means to determine if they  or members of their unit have become isolated. \\nISG includes criteria that define isolation in a give n situation. Commanders set isolation criteria based on \\nthe commander’s personnel recovery guidance, which th ey refine for use at th e appropriate level. The \\ncriteria consist of a short list of f actors specific to the situation. Co mmanders ensure isolation criteria are \\nconcise, direct, and easy to interpret. Fewer criteria are more easily remembered under stress. \\n3-27. Isolation criteria are simpler to define for air and vehicle crews forced to divert from their missions \\nby enemy action or mechanical malfunction. Isolation criteria are more complex for ground operations, \\nwhere separations from friendly forces and contact with the enemy are often a duty requirement. \\n3-28.

However, top-down monitoring does not relieve \\nindividuals of responsibility for their own protection and awareness of their situation.  \\nRapid Reporting \\n3-30. Closely related to accountability is rapid reporting of isolating events. ISG addresses how isolated \\npersons will attempt to contact their unit—or recovery forces—and how units will report isolating events to \\ntheir command. Topics related to reporting include use of ground-to-air and ground-to-ground signals. The \\nsignals component of ISG typically addresses the use of radios, distress beacons, and other electronic \\ndevices. ISG may specify visual signals. To facilitate accurate re porting of isolating events, ISG may \\nprescribe specific items of equipment Soldiers will po ssess, such as maps of the AO. If Soldiers carry \\ndistress beacons, the ISG directs when to activate them. In the field, a low-tech solution is frequently just as \\neffective as an electronic solution. Visual signals such  as flares, signal lights (strobe lights, chemical light \\nsticks, and flashlights), colored panels, glint tape, reflective mirrors, signal fires, and the use of natural \\nmaterials (stones, snow, or vegetation, depending on the terrain and weather) augment electronic signal \\nmeans. \\nActions to Take When Isolated \\n3-31.

Commanders analyze their operational environment, anticipate the isolation risk, and recommend \\nactions most likely to be effective. In their guidance, commanders provide straightforward instructions, \\nsuch as to— \\n\\uf06c Stay with the vehicle until dark, unless discovered by enemy, hostile, or criminal forces. \\n\\uf06c Move south along the river valley toward friendly forces if forced to leave the vehicle by enemy \\npressure.  \\n\\uf06c Avoid populated areas to the west of the main highway. \\n\\uf06c Move toward the rally point in the woods, when possible, to the east of the intersection of \\nHighways 1 and 9. \\n\\uf06c Activate the distress beacon when in a covered and concealed location. \\n\\uf06c Be prepared to authenticate identity by using the daily password and countersign. \\n3-33.

A unit forwards evasion plans of action up the chain of command. The goal is to improve the \\nprobability of recovering isolated persons by giving recovery forces information about the isolated persons’  \\nmission and intentions in case of isolation.

The characteristics of major combat operations incr ease the complexity and uncertainty of personnel \\nrecovery operations. Large-scale offensive and defensive tasks involve complex operations against the \\nuniformed armed forces of nation-stat es. Operations against hybrid thre ats can evolve into major combat \\noperations. In Vietnam, from 1954 to 1975, a nationalistic guerilla movement, with outside support, grew \\ninto an intense conflict involving major ground and air combat. Military operations in Vietnam illustrate \\nthe ongoing risk of isolation for air and land forces. During major combat, enemies may have large \\nstanding armies with modern weapons or a combin ation of conventional and irregular capabilities. Some \\npossess nuclear weapons.

The complexity of major combat operations strains military capabilities, including personnel \\nrecovery capabilities. Major combat operations may cover wide areas and involve large numbers of \\npersonnel and equipment. Thousands of people and vehicles deploy to hundreds—if not thousands—of \\nlocations. The enemy may field equal numbers. Battles and engagements may cause hundreds of potential \\nisolation incidents. Friendly forces face the risk of isolation daily.  \\n4-3. Personnel, contractors, and others supporting frien dly forces may become isolated. The availability \\nof diplomatic, civilian, and military personnel recovery options does not mitigate the risk. Commanders and \\nstaff understand that the more partners participating in operations, the more complex the situation. \\n4-4. Wounds, injuries, and illness complicate isolation in cidents, especially in the numbers associated \\nwith major combat. The raid on the Pangatian prison camp near Cabanatuan, Luzon, in the Philippines \\nduring World War II illustrates the transportation and medical challenges of rescuing large numbers of \\nprisoners held for long periods.

On 30 January 1 945, a mixed force of Filipino guerillas, Army Rangers, \\nand Alamo Scouts rescued over 500 prisoners from the camp. Some had been held since the fall of Bataan \\nand Corregidor almost three years earlier. All had been mistreated, most were malnourished, and many \\nwere sick, wounded, or injured—including those held in the zero ward of the prison hospital, where they \\nwere judged to have no chance of survival. After the successful fight, the rescue force had to carry the \\nliberated prisoners to a location remote from the camp before giving them food and water. From there the \\nrecovery force put the weakest and sickest on carts. When they reached U.S. lines, Sixth Army trucks met \\nthem and transported the group to freedom.  \\n4-5. Even for persons isolated for short periods, personnel recovery operations must include adequate \\ntransportation, prompt medical aid, food and water, physical security, and behavioral health remediation. \\nCaptors may hold isolated persons in small groups or large numbers and even in a medical treatment \\nfacility. Recovering isolated persons protected by the enemy requires adequate personnel, physical security, \\nand transportation resources.

For example, Captain (Chaplain) Emil J. Kapaun \\nmade such a decision in November 1950. At the start of the Korean War in June 1950, he deployed to \\nKorea as the chaplain of the 3rd Battalion of the 8th Cavalry Regiment. During fierce combat with Chinese \\nforces in North Korea, his unit was under heavy pressure and preparing to withdraw toward friendly lines \\nwhen he was told that wounded 3rd Battalion Soldiers were surrounded and could not withdraw. \\nAccompanied by Captain (Doctor) Clarence L. Anderson, Father Kapaun left the secure perimeter and \\nfound the men. He ministered to the Soldiers until captured by the enemy. He was the only member of the \\ngroup not wounded. He elected to remain with the Soldiers—to isolate himself—rather than evade and \\nreturn to friendly lines. Father Kapaun died in captivity.  \\n4-7. The mission is always paramount. The Soldier’s Creed and the Warrior Ethos (see ADP 1 and \\nTC 3-21.75) make it clear that the Army values its members, but the mission is foremost. At the tactical \\nlevel, this often creates tension between accomplishing the mission and protecting those endangering their \\nlives for the mission.

Expectations of life-saving personnel recovery \\noperations prove challenging to meet in the conditions of major combat.  \\nTHE UNCERTAINTY OF PERSONNEL RECOVERY IN MAJOR COMBAT OPERATIONS \\n4-8. Civilians within an operational area increase the uncertainty of personnel recovery activities, \\nparticularly in densely populated areas. Complex or un familiar cultural factors make it difficult to predict \\ncivilian behavior for or against isolated Soldiers . A local population or group opposed to friendly \\noperations make personnel recovery operations more  challenging. Groups or individuals supportive of \\nenemy forces enhance the intelligence gathering capabilities of the enemy and increase the threat to isolated \\npersons. Conversely, friendly populations are a boon to allied intelligence and support networks.

Army commanders at every level are committed to the safety and security of their organizations. \\nThey emphasize personnel recovery to prevent Army fo rces from becoming isolated, missing, or captured \\nand lessen the tactical, operational, and strategic impact of isolation incidents. Commanders and staffs at all \\nechelons must guard against treating personnel recovery  as episodic. They must anticipate requirements. \\nCommanders who adequately resource personnel recovery elements with a full-time staff minimize the \\nadverse impact of personnel recovery operations on mission accomplishment. This is especially important \\nin major combat operations, where a robust recovery  capability raises troop morale. This is because \\nSoldiers can execute their missions in extremely h azardous conditions with the confidence that they can \\nsuccessfully avoid or contend with isolation incidents.  \\nCAUSES OF ISOLATION INCIDENTS \\n4-10.

The categories are flexible and do not exclude other \\npossible causes. \\nISOLATION BY FRIENDLY BEHAVIOR \\n4-11. The most frequent cause of isolation incidents is friendly force behavior, regardless of the situation. \\nThe actions prescribed by warning orders, OPORDs , or FRAGORDs occasionally  expose the force or \\nindividuals to unknown, underestimat ed, or even unacceptable risk of is olation. The information available \\nfor supporting situational awareness and decisionmaking may be incomplete or flawed. A leader exercising \\nindividual initiative sometimes directs a COA that leads to isolation, such as deviating from a planned route \\nto take advantage of a just-discovered shortcut. An on-the-spot decision based on available information \\nseems appropriate for an urgent situation, such as autorotating a helicopter with an engine failure.'),\n",

Subsequent rapid decisions may compound the risk. Leaving the initial site of the isolation to \\naffect self-recovery, avoid enemy c ontact, or seek medical attention ma y exacerbate the situation. Rapid \\ndecisions may cause forces to become lost. Once isolat ed, some forces do not receive orders to move, so \\nthey stay in a vulnerable location.  In major combat operations, the number of these types of isolation \\nincidents is proportional to the number of forces deployed. \\nISOLATION BY ENEMY ACTION \\n4-12. Units sometimes become isolated when an enemy force separates them from other friendly forces. \\nEnemy forces observing the isolation incident race to the scene, seeking to kill or capture isolated Soldiers. \\nFriendly forces race to recover them. If an unassisted evasion or an im mediate recovery by friendly forces \\nis not successful, commanders decide whether to moun t a deliberate recovery ope ration.

The decisi on affects the ongoing \\nmission as well as the morale of the organization. \\n4-13. In major combat, Army forces isolated by hostile action are frequently in the most dangerous \\npersonnel recovery situation because they are typi cally under enemy observation. They may have the \\nmeans to resist, but if cut off from support for extended periods, they eventually may evade returning to \\nfriendly control or even be forced to surrender. The personnel recovery structure, especially one strictly \\nbased on search and rescue, can become overwhelmed. In these circumstances, extraction by aircraft is \\ngenerally impractical because of the number of aircraft necessary to move large groups. Furthermore, the \\npresence of enemy antiaircraft and other direct-fire weapons makes airborne recovery dangerous for \\naircrews.

All actions taken immediately after capture, before \\nmovement to a prisoner of war camp, and after dete ntion are personnel recovery activities. The Third 1949 \\nGeneva Convention defines this status—while under the control of the detaining force but before entering \\nan incarceration facility—as being a prisoner of war. Any activity, large or small, involved in the \\nrepatriation of prisoners of war is considered a personnel recovery operation. \\nISOLATION BY THE ENVIRONMENT \\n4-16. The physical environment, including climate and weather conditions, can cause groups or individuals \\nto become isolated. Inclement weather, biological co ntamination, chemical pollution, and the damage to \\nterrain from combat cause isolation and complicate pers onnel recovery operations. A fast-flowing or deep \\nriver, large lake, wide crevasse, sheer cliff, seemingly impenetrable swamp, or unrelenting mud caused by \\nheavy rain can create or contribute to isolation.

When large or aggressive \\nenemy formations are present, the situation is especially challenging. \\nCONDUCTING THE OPERATIONS PROCESS \\n4-17. Army commanders and staffs conducting the operations process for personnel recovery missions use \\njudgment in applying the principles discussed in chapter 1. Paragraphs 4-18 through 4-24 discuss in detail \\nhow they plan, prepare, execute, and assess personnel recovery operations. \\nPLANNING FOR PERSONNEL RECOVERY OPERATIONS \\n4-18. Commanders and staffs analyze their operational environments using the operational variables—\\npolitical, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment, and time. \\nCommanders and staffs use the mission variables as a filter to extract from the operational variables the \\ninformation staffs need to conduct an operation and commanders need to exercise mission command. \\nHigher command echelons ensure their personnel recovery guidance is appropriate for an operational \\nenvironment. Tactical-level commanders ensure the ISG is appropriate for the situation on the ground. \\nSeveral enemy characteristics are important in determ ining the risk of isolation such as composition,'),\n",

Army planners use an Army planning methodology to focus the personnel recovery planning effort. \\nThey define the problem, gather information, develop possible solutions, analyze and select the best \\nsolution, and implement it.

Stability has distinct characteristics that influe nce personnel recovery operations. For example, \\ncommand and support relationships frequently vary. Army forces operate under joint command and control, \\nunder the control of a multinational force, or under the operational control of a civilian entity, such as the \\nDOS. They may also operate in conjunction with HN forces. Soldiers and other designated persons are \\namong the population, they are vulnerable to hybrid threats, and they often operate under restrictive rules of \\nengagement or rules on the use of force. \\n5-2. Army forces conduct offensive, defensive, and stability tasks simultaneously. One unit may find \\nitself conducting offensive or defensive tasks, while another unit is establishing civil control, providing \\nsupport to governance, or training HN military forces.

Personnel recovery characteristics in stability \\ninclude addressing the local national sovereignt y, HN security forces, local populations, and \\nintergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations. These factors interact to  increase uncertainty and \\nthe chance of isolation. \\nNATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY \\n5-3. Supporting the national sovereignty of the host nation is an important consideration in any \\ndeployment overseas. Nation-states are sovereign within their own territory. Army forces conducting \\npersonnel recovery activities do not violate this right. When a functional, effective HN government exists, \\nArmy and joint forces work with local civil and military authorities. Personnel recovery activities have a \\ngreater chance of success when the host nation is permissive and encourages U.S. military operations or is, \\nat least, amenable to the presence of those forces on  or over its territory.

It is common for nations to desire a light footprint of U.S. forces in stability operations for internal or \\nregional political reasons, especially during foreign hu manitarian assistance.

HN security forces represent a si gnificant potential for personnel recovery support in stability. The \\nArmy’s relationship with a host nation can be long or short term, depending on the situation. In long-term \\nrelationships, the United States has a long-standing bilateral diplomatic, economic, and military partnership \\nwith the host nation. In long-term relationships, the Un ited States may have formed a more recent security \\ncooperation pact with the goal of stabilizing the ov erseas nation while advancing the national security \\ninterests of the United States. In still other situations, an ad hoc relationship exists to address a temporary \\nstate of affairs. An example of an ad hoc relationship is one resulting from a response to a natural or man-\\nmade disaster. In each relationship, the Army as part of a joint force co nducts synchronization and \\ncoordination, and establishes liaison with the armed fo rces, national police, and other internal security \\nforces of the host nation as part of unified action. \\n5-13.

National \\nsecurity forces—police and armed forces—are the first responders. They have elements throughout most of \\nthe country, including remote locations where U.S. fo rces may perform stability tasks. HN security forces \\nare generally politically well connected. They facilitate coordination in personnel recovery. Wide \\ndistribution and political connectivity are important in timely intelligence collection and analysis. The most \\nimportant relationship is often the American Embassy’s relationship with the national police and \\nintelligence services.

A number of independent actors influence stability . Joint and Army forces in stability operations \\ninterface with entities that possess various experience , resources, mandates, and capabilities. Some global \\norganizations have broad mandates, while local organizations have specific, limited missions. These \\norganizations sometimes provide valuable assistance in personnel recovery. \\n5-16. Army forces at all levels aim to build strong relationships with independent actors through ongoing \\ncooperation and coordination. Examples of potential partners include the United Nations and the \\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross. The United Nations operates in most joint and Army operational \\nareas.

Additionally, independent actors have \\nknowledge networks that can prove a valuable resource during isolation incidents.  \\n5-17. Many organizations wish to maintain independent and separate from Army forces. However, \\nobjectives of stability frequently align with those objectives of the independent actors. At the least, \\nreasonable deconfliction of purpose is possible. Freq uently, the United Nations, DOS, or the United States \\nAgency for International Development facilitate s the interface between Army forces and other \\nintergovernmental or nongovernmental organizations. The interface includes Army efforts to recover or \\nprevent isolation of civilian members of these organizations, when required.'),\n",

Commanders do not delay initiating cooperation and c oordination in advance of potential isolation \\nincidents. This includes the potential isolation of Soldiers or civilians. They anticipate the need and do not \\nallow inadequate coordination and training to limit e ffectiveness of recovery op erations. They plan to \\ncompensate for differences in communications equipment, signals, training, and procedures. Commanders \\nconsider the makeup of the work force of potential partners. \\nISOLATION RISK IN STABILITY  \\n5-19. Risks impact personnel recovery operations. The most common type is accidental risk. Since military \\noperations are inherently dangerous, the chance of accidents increases. Ac cidents often cause or contribute \\nto isolation. Other types of risk in clude the presence of a threat from en emy forces, criminal elements, or a \\nhostile environment. \\n5-20. Stability tasks may not require the same level of protection as major combat operations. A \\ncommander and staff still conduct risk assessments to determine the probability of an isolation incident \\noccurring and its potential impact on mission accomplishment.

Personnel recovery challenges commanders of stability operations to respond quickly to an isolation \\nincident with sufficient forces. In most stability situations, the final assessment of risk is a judgment call by \\nthe commander. The commander considers not only the severity of the negative outcome but also its \\nprobability. (See ATP 5-19 for more detailed information on risk management.) Generally, the risk of \\nisolation for the friendly force is proportional to the size of that force and the degree and distance of \\nseparation from other friendly forces, including recovery  forces.

Commanders consider stabil ity characteristics when developing approaches to reduce the risk of \\nisolation incidents. First, large numbers of Soldiers , Army civilians, contractors, and other designated \\nindividuals support stability operations. Usually, individu al risk of isolation is low, but the net risk is \\nconsiderable in context of the number of exposures on a daily basis overseas. Second, because the scope of \\nstability operations is worldwide, the Army pers onnel recovery structure and training mission are \\nworldwide. Personnel recovery operations with unified action partners are the norm. Third, although \\nisolation risk is highly variable, personnel recovery planners can weight their effort in areas considered \\nhigh risk. However, in areas of high risk, frequently fewer partners help mitigate the risk. Forces adapt the \\npersonnel recovery structure to an operational environment. In addition to providing personnel recovery \\neducation and training, commanders use a mix of approaches for risk reduction. These approaches include \\nacceptance, protection, and deterrence. \\nFigure 5-2. Isolation risk \\nACCEPTANCE \\n5-23.

The Army has long understood that winning the “hearts and minds” of a \\nlocal population goes a long  way to establishing cond itions for eventual success and reducing the threat of \\nisolation. This approach takes time. \\n5-24. At the local level, commanders can prepare mutual agreements between Army forces and local \\nleaders. Special operations forces often use the acceptan ce approach. Such an appr oach led to the Sons of \\nIraq awakening movement in Iraq’s Anbar Province in 2005. Sunni Muslim militias collaborated with \\nfriendly forces to increase the level of security and reduce the risk of isolation in the region.

Protection is the use of internal control measures to reduce the risk of isolation incidents by reducing \\nvulnerability. It is primarily passive. This approach emphasizes protection TTP to preserve the force and \\nmaximize combat power. Such tasks as training and edu cation in operations security, survivability, health \\nmaintenance, safety, and chemical, biological, and radiological defense reduce the vulnerability. One \\nexample of a protection control measure is the existence of a robust personnel recovery infrastructure, \\nstaffed by competent people and interconnected with HN and regional governmental authorities. A \\npotential shortcoming of protection control measures is that they contribute to a bunker mentality. The \\nforce fixated on protection looks inward and expends its resources on protection instead of reaching out to \\naccomplish the stability mission. \\nDETERRENCE \\n5-26. Deterrence is an external protection control measure using the counter-threat of force to discourage \\nenemies and mitigate isolation risk. Deterrence encourages the perception that Army forces can and will \\nreach out and retaliate against perpetrators.

Additionally, Army units \\ntypically deploy only elements of units with limite d equipment. Most situations are more volatile and \\nuncertain early in the operation. Early responding Soldiers may begin operations immediately upon arrival. \\nThose unfamiliar with an operational environment may not recognize isolation hazards and inadvertently \\nplace themselves at risk. Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (known as CBRN) hazards could \\npose a potential threat. Moreover, criminals coul d pose a threat to a response force. Destroyed \\ninfrastructure and devastated terrain may also affect operations. \\n6-4. Because of the immature protection situation in the early phase of deployment, unassisted recovery is \\nthe norm. This has implications for equipment and tr aining of initial Army responders. Soldiers often \\noperate independently at a time when their commanders and staffs may not be able to influence task \\norganization arrangements for optimal personnel recovery operations. The risks of Soldiers becoming \\nisolated in a DSCA environment are not to be underestimated.'),\n",

Within these primary tasks, Soldiers may perform various tasks such as firefighting, responding to \\ncivil disturbances, protecting critical infrastructure, or supporting federal and state counterdrug efforts. \\nEach task may include personnel recovery as an implied risk. In the domestic environment, training and \\nequipping only a few specialized personnel, such as  aviators and special operations forces, does not \\nsignificantly mitigate risk to the force. \\n6-7. The response to any emergency always begins at the local level and grows from the bottom up, based \\non the National Response Framework and the National Incident Management System (discussed in \\nADP 3-28 and ADRP 3-28).

Accountability is one of the immediate challenges, as leaders coordinate the differing civilian and \\nmilitary personnel accountability system s. Accountability proves difficult because of the desire to respond \\nto the incident and immediately begin operations. Individuals, units, and their associated headquarters \\ndeploy, establish a presence in th e operational area, and establish a chain of command. During initial \\ndeployment, the risk of isolation is greatest since Army and civilian leadership may still be coordinating \\nwho is working in what locations. The initial need to establish a personnel recovery structure with a \\ndoctrinal foundation includes wide-ranging personnel recovery guidance. This critical time requires fully \\nstaffed PRCSs and comprehensive ISG be provided to both military and civilian responders. Leaders must \\nremind Soldiers that the greatest danger of isolation is during the initial deployment in DSCA. \\nRESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF FORCE \\n6-10.

The second phase is the longest phase during the deployment.

Transitions are always a time of both maxi mum attentiveness and the greatest confusion. The \\ntransition may be from civil authorities to a response force, from one response force to another or—most \\nprobably—a combination of the two. All three of these transitions call for in creased awareness of the \\npotential for an isolation incident. \\n6-18. The length of each phase depends on the nature of the emergency. Factors such as the magnitude of \\nthe disaster, the duration of the incident, the degree of perceived risk, the training and readiness of the \\nresponse forces, and the level of cooperation betw een civil authorities and the Army force concerning \\npersonnel recovery determine its length. Regardless of the scope of a task and the discrete phases portrayed \\nin figure 5-1, Army commanders and staffs consider the entire duration in terms of personnel recovery \\nvulnerability and control measures to mitigate potential isolation events. \\nCOMMANDER AND STAFF FOCUS IN DEFENSE SUPPORT OF \\nCIVIL AUTHORITIES \\n6-19.

COIN is a complex subset of warfa re that encompasses all military, paramilitary, political, \\neconomic, psychological, and civic actions taken by a government to defeat an insurgency at the company, battalion, \\nand brigade levels. To do this, the manual merges traditional approaches to COIN with the realities of the current \\noperational environment. \\nThe US Army thinking and doctrine on COIN tactics since the end of World War II have focused on the conduct \\nof counterguerrilla operations in the later stages of insu rgency. The Army has seen itself as defeating guerrilla \\nforces—usually communist forces—rather than defeating an entire insurgency. It saw success as something it could \\nachieve by using the force of arms directly against guerrilla forces. This doctrine of COIN began to take shape shortly \\nafter World War II in manuals such as FM 31-20, Operations against Guerrilla Forces (1951) and later in FM 31-15, \\nOperations against Irregular Forces  (1961). The Army refined its counterinsurgency doctrine during Vietnam \\nin FM 31-22, US Counterinsurgency Force , FM 31-16, Counterguerrilla Operations  (both published in 1963) \\nand in FM 31-23, Stability and Support Operations  (1972). After Vietnam, the Army split COIN doctrine off from'),\n",

After Vietnam, the Army split COIN doctrine off from \\nconventional “high intensity” operations in FM 100-20, Military Operations in Low Intensity Conflict (1990) in which \\nthe “light” forces owned counterinsurgency, and FM 90-8, Counterguerrilla Operations  (1986), where the focus \\nremained on defeating the guerrilla force. This manual is the historical successor to FM 90-8. In addition, parts of FM \\n100-20 have been integrated into this FM, as have the Ar my’s concept of full-spectrum operations and all elements \\nof COIN operations. \\nAt its heart, a counterinsurgency is an armed struggle fo r the support of the population. This support can be achieved \\nor lost through information engagement, strong repres entative government, access to goods and services, fear, \\nor violence. This armed struggle also involves eliminating insurgents who threaten the safety and security of the \\npopulation. However, military units alone cannot defeat an insurgency. Most of the work involves discovering \\nand solving the population’s underlying issues, that is, the root causes of their dissatisfaction with the current \\narrangement of political power.

Dealing with diverse issues such as land reform, unemployment, oppressive \\nleadership, or ethical tensions places a premium on tactical  leaders who can not only close with the enemy, but also \\nnegotiate agreements, operate with nonmilitary agencies and other nations, restore basic services, speak the native (a \\nforeign) language, orchestrate political deals, and get \"the word\" on the street. \\nToday’s counterinsurgent battlefield is increasingly cluttere d with US, Host Nation, and other coalition forces, each \\nwith its own strengths and limitations. In addition, mu ltiple insurgent groups, nongovernmental organizations, armed \\ncontractors, and a local population divided into several ethnic groups add to this clutter. A counterinsurgency \\nlong-range plan for a tactical unit combines offensive, de fensive and stability operations. To achieve the appropriate \\nratio between these and accomplish unity of effort among diverse units and actors, units must build long-term plans \\naround the seven counterinsurgency lines of effort: establish civil security, establish civil control, support Host Nation \\nforces, support to governance, restore essential servi ces, support economic and infrastructure development, \\nand conduct information engagement.'),\n",

These act ions can range from killing or capturing an insurgent cell \\nknown to emplace IEDs, to solving unemployment in an area, to publicizing the opening of a water treatment facility. \\nWithout unity of effort over time, the tactical unit’s long-range plan will face challenges in securing the population, \\ngathering the population’s support, and defeating the insurgency. \\nCounterinsurgency is an iterative process.

In addition, the world is increasingly shaped \\nby population explosion, urbanization,  globalization, technology, religious  fundamentalism, resource demand, \\nclimate change and natural disasters, and prolifera tion of weapons of mass destruction. The increasing \\ncomplexity of the world has made it more challenging for governments to maintain order and satisfy the rapidly \\ngrowing needs of their populations. As these governments try to maintain their tenuous hold on power, \\ndissatisfied portions of their population have, like dissatisfied groups for thousands of years, turned to violence \\nto achieve political goals. Using violence to achieve political goals is known as insurgency. As a result, US \\nforces have conducted counterinsurgency operations  around the world in Colombia, Somalia, Kosovo, \\nAfghanistan, the Philippines, and Iraq.

Eight forces are shaping current operational environments: \\nPOPULATION EXPLOSION \\n1-7. Population explosion is the rapi d growth of the world’s popula tion over the last six decades. \\nIn 1950, the world’s population was 2. 5 billion people; in 2008, the popula tion is estimated at 6.5 billion \\npeople; and in 2050, the population is  expected to reach 9 billion. Th e population explosion provides more \\nopportunities for the insurgent to hi de within the population and places  a premium on winning the struggle \\nfor the populace’s support. As the population continues to grow, governments will struggle to provide their \\npeople with food, water, and power, giving potential insurgent groups an opportunity to exploit a \\nvulnerable population. \\nURBANIZATION \\n1-8. Urbanization is the growth of urban areas due to both a population surge and migration. In 1950, \\n29 percent of the world’s population lived in urban areas; in 2008, almost 50 percent of the population \\nlives in urban areas; and by 2050, it is estimated that 60 percent of the population will live in urban areas. \\nThis rapid growth of urban areas indicates that there is a greater potential that future insurgencies will be \\nfought in urban areas. \\nGLOBALIZATION \\n1-9.

Religious fundamentalism is defined as a belief in the infallibility of hol y scriptures, absolute \\nreligious authority, and strict adherence to a set of ba sic religious principles without any compromise with \\nmodern life. As nation-states struggle to provide for their people, some of the dissatisfied population, as a \\nbacklash against globalization, will turn to religious fundamentalism to provide those needs that the \\nnation-state cannot. (This is a primary insurgent ideology, and is further discussed in Chapter 2.) \\nRESOURCE DEMAND \\n1-12.

Even, a tactical unit will use the operational variables as a way to define their operational \\nenvironment, which often corresponds to their area of interest (AI). \\nOPERATIONAL VARIABLES \\n1-15.

Successful counterinsurgents must therefore not only prevent insurgents from \\nobtaining this goal, but also actively work to influence public opinion for the COIN mission. \\n1-18. Commanders must be prepared to operate within a broad range of political structures. The Host \\nNation’s form of government may range from a despotic dictatorship to a struggling democracy. \\nCommanders at all levels, including platoon leaders and company commanders, need to recognize the \\nimportance of establishing and reinforcing the HN as the lead authority for all operations. This reinforces \\nthe legitimacy of the HN government. \\nMILITARY \\n1-19. This variable includes the military capabilities of all armed forces. Most COIN units will need \\nto analyze the insurgency’s military forces (guerrillas) , local militias, and the Host Nation security forces. \\nCommanders should consider qualitative aspects, such as conscription or recruitment systems, economic \\nbasis (to include appropriations system), and position of  forces in national and local government structure. \\nAdditional qualitative considerations are general orga nization, training and doctr ine, efficiency, rapport \\nwith population, and the police role in the nation’s internal security.

The economic variable consists of the general economic categories of an Area of Operations \\n(AO), such as energy; raw materials; government development policy; distribution of labor and labor \\npolicies; income distribution; national food distribution; fr ee market or socialist interface and functions; \\nconsumption patterns; external investment, taxation policy; port authorities; movement of goods; consumer \\nissues; border controls; foreign trade; tariffs; and graft or corruption. \\n1-21.

To achieve this, they try to \\ncontrol, manipulate, and distribute information. \\n1-25.  Understanding the existing comm unication system is important because it influences local, \\nregional, national, and international audiences. Media coverage, in particular, influences US political \\ndecision-making, popular opinion, and the sensitivities of coalition members, while the local teahouse may \\ncontrol the community’s opinion and the “word on the street.” Commanders must use information \\nengagements to fully achieve their tactical goals. \\n1-26.  Insurgents observe the actions of both government and COIN forces. Insurgents often use \\npropaganda to gain creditability and legitimacy w ith the population, while simultaneously undermining \\ntheir opponents. Successful insurgen ts strive to seize the moral high ground on any counterinsurgent \\nmistakes, both real and perceived.

The infrastructure variable includes the basic facilities, services, and installations needed for a \\ncommunity or society to function.  The state of the infrastructure determines the resources required \\nfor reconstruction.

While analysis, in terms of the operational va riables, improves understanding of the operational \\nenvironment, it does not lend itself di rectly to mission accomplishment. For operations at the tactical level, \\nthe Army uses the mission variables of METT-TC (missi on, enemy, terrain and weather, troops available, \\ntime available, and civil considerations) to help a unit understand its mission within the context of its \\nspecific OE. For COIN, civil considerations are especially important.

Civil considerations overlay. \\nCIVIL CONSIDERATION MATRIXES \\n1-41. A separate matrix is a useful tool for each of  the six ASCOPE categories for any demographic \\ngroup. Also helpful is an ASCOPE map overlay that  shows the boundaries of each identified demographic \\ngroup. The government’s districts ( police, utilities, political) often fall along natural demographic lines.  \\nWhen they do not, the boundary conflicts with how the population defines its neighborhood. This can \\ncause friction between the population and government. For each area, staffs might want to first identify the \\ndemographic group it contains. Then, they can work through the rest of the ASCOPE categories. For \\nexample, a unit with an area that has two main tribes should deve lop a separate ASCOPE matrix for each \\ntribe. Three key perspectives aid in understanding the categories of ASCOPE: \\nPOPULATION OR POPULACE \\n1-42. This refers to the local community. \\nINSURGENT \\n1-43. This refers to any group illegally impeding the f unctions of the government, such as insurgents, \\nmilitias, gangs, criminals, foreign agents, and terrorists. \\nCOUNTERINSURGENT \\n1-44.

There are three prerequisites fo r an insurgency to be succe ssful in an area—a vulnerable \\npopulation, leadership available for direction, and lack of government control. When all three exist in an \\narea, an insurgency can operate with some freedom of movement, gain the support of the people, \\nand become entrenched over time. \\nVULNERABLE POPULATION \\n1-88. A population is vulnerable if the people have real or perceived grievances that insurgents can \\nexploit. The insurgents can expl oit the population by offering hope fo r change as well as exploiting \\npolitical, economic, or social dissatisfaction with the current government. A gap between population’s \\nexpectations and the capability to meet these exp ectations may cause unrest within the population, \\nincluding turning to insurgency. The larger the gap, the greater the population’s perceived, or relative, \\nsense of deprivation between what they have and what they perceive they should have.

A vulnerable population alone will not support an insurgency. Th ere must be a leadership element \\nthat can direct the frustrations of the population. If insu rgents can recruit, co-opt, or coerce local leaders or \\nthe local leaders are part of the insurgency, these leaders can direct the frustrations of the populace. \\nLACK OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL \\n1-90. Real or perceived lack of govern mental control can allow insurgen ts to operate with little or no \\ninterference from security forces or other agencies . The greater the control the government has over the \\nsituation, the less likely are the chances for insurgen t success. The opposite is also true. If the government \\nis not providing what the people believe their government should, insurgents may provide an alternative \\ngovernment, or “shadow” government, or they may merely nullify governance to allow freedom of action \\nand movement, depending on their end state. Host Nation failure to see or admit that there is an issue \\nor outright refusal to change can further strengthen this prerequisite. \\nROOT CAUSES \\n1-91. There are five general categories of root causes fo r insurgencies. A root cause is the basis of a \\ngrievance among the population. Some or all of these grievances may fuel an insurgency to varying \\ndegrees. The importance of the root causes, or even their existence, can change over time. Additionally,'),\n",

Additionally, \\ninsurgents may be adept at manipulating or creating root causes and grievances to serve their purpose. \\nIDENTITY \\n1-92. Many factors impact a person’s sense of identity , but membership in a socio cultural group may \\nhave the deepest influence. Strong feelings based on identity can be in conf lict with the group identity \\nof the majority of the members of the Host Nation government, potentially leading to insurgencies with \\nsecession or political overthrow as goals. External nations with similar social identities as the insurgents \\nmay assist. \\nRELIGION \\n1-93.

In this way, religious fundamentalism or extremism can become a root cause \\nof an insurgency in and of itself. External groups w ith similar extremist religious views as the insurgents \\nmay assist. \\nOCCUPATION OR EXPLOITATION \\n1-94. Popular perception of outsiders either occupyi ng the HN, or excessive HN pandering to outsiders, \\ncan be a source of insurgency.

Culture conditions the individual’s range of action and ideas, including what to do and not do, \\nhow to do or not do it, and whom to do it with or not to do it with. Culture also includes under what \\ncircumstances the “rules” shift and change. Culture influences how people make judgments about what \\nis right and wrong, assess what is important and unimportant, categorize things, and deal with things that \\ndo not fit into existing categories. Cultural rules are flexible in practice. \\nTaxonomy \\n1-99. One simple way to show a culture is to build a chart that systematically distinguishes, orders, \\nand names groups—a cultural taxonomy. In order to do th is, leaders and staffs must define a culture’s \\ninfluences, variations, and manifestations. Cultu ral influences and cultural variations explain why the \\nculture is the way it is. Cultural manifestations refer to what one may encounter in a culture.

They often include women, \\nchildren and other individuals that tend to be less scrutinized by counterinsurgent forces. Examples \\nof auxiliaries include shepherds or street merchants that may openly ope rate near a counterinsurgent base \\nand provide intelligence on that site. Examples of support that auxiliaries provide include— \\n• Store weapons and supplies. \\n• Perform courier operations. \\n• Provide passive intelligence collection. \\n• Give early warning of counterinsurgent movements.'),\n",

In general, there are three categories of leadership found in insurgencies. They are— \\nSingle person \\n2-15. One person may be the overall leader of an insurg ency. This leadership structure has one person \\nwho provides cohesion, motivation, and direction for th e insurgency. Cuba’s Fidel Castro is an excellent \\nexample of a single person leadership structure. However, this single lead er may centralize power \\nor decentralize decision-making and execution, leaving decision-making a nd execution to subordinates. At \\nthe local level, most units will see organizations controlled by a single person. \\nSingle group or party \\n2-16. The insurgency may be headed by a ruling council that makes and executes policy. This \\nleadership group or party may also control other groups involved in the insurgency. China’s Communist \\nParty, before the ascendancy of Mao, is an example of a group leading an insurgency. \\nGroup of groups \\n2-17. Different groups that have different concepts of  how the country should be governed make up the \\nleadership. Under this kind of leadership, there w ill be many leaders, possibly unified only by their \\nopposition to the government. They compete with each other and the government. Example: The partisan \\nforces in Yugoslavia and Greece during World War II were united in their fight against the German \\noccupation, but ranged from monarchist to democratic to communi st. Sometimes, they fought each other'),\n",

Sometimes, they fought each other \\nmore violently than they did the Germans. \\n2-18. As a group, insurgent leaders operate in either a decentralized or centralized manner. \\nDecentralized \\n2-19. The power base of some insurgencies is co llective and does not depend on specific leaders \\nor personalities to be effective. These insurgencies are easier to penetrate, but recover rapidly when they \\nlose key personnel. Decentralization restricts an insurgency in its ability to f unction as a coherent body \\nand to create a viable counter state.  However, decentralized insurgencies are very ha rd to destroy and can \\ncontinue to sow disorder, even wh en degraded. For example, Al Qaed a in 2008 is a loose, decentralized \\norganization held together by an ideal of re-establishing the Caliphate. \\nCentralized \\n2-20. Other organizations depend on a single, often charismatic personality to provide cohesion, \\nmotivation, and direction. Centralized insurgencies make decisions and initiate new actions rapidly. \\nHowever, they are vulnerable to disruptions if key personalities are removed, co-opted, discredited, \\nor eliminated. These insurgencies are often led by traditional authority  figures such as tribal sheikhs, local \\nwarlords, and religious leaders. For example, Tecums eh was the major factor in  the creation of Shawnee'),\n",

Identifying leaders can be critical  in determining an insurgency’s organizational structure, \\nstrategy, and tactics. Understandi ng the basic beliefs, intentions, cap abilities, and vulnerabilities of known \\nkey leaders is extremely important to countering insurgency. Removing these key leaders will normally \\ndegrade an organization’s capab ilities.

Insurgencies normally seek to achieve one of  three objectives: to overthrow the existing \\ngovernment in order to reallocate power, to expel whom they perceive to be “outsiders” or “occupiers,\" or \\nto seek to create or maintain a re gion where there is little or no government al control that they can exploit. \\nInsurgents’ objectives include struggles for independence against colonial powers; the rising up \\nof political, ethnic, or religious groups against their rivals; and resistan ce to foreign invaders.

Examples of strategic \\nobjectives include— \\n• Overthrow an established government. \\n• Establish an autonomous national territory. \\n• Cause the withdrawal of a foreign occupying power. \\n• Extract political concessions. \\nOPERATIONAL \\n2-25.

Insurgents typically work toward achieving ten general objectives as they gain the support of the \\npopulation. Insurgent activity, like all other aspect of the insurgency, develops and evolves over time. \\nObtaining Popular Support \\n2-36. Insurgent operations are normally focused directly or indirectly at decreasing support to the \\nexisting government. Simultaneously, competent insurgents try to gain support for the insurgent movement \\nthrough propaganda, coercion, or by causing terror. If they cannot gain  active support, they will seek \\npassive support such as silence. \\nUndermining Host Nation Legitimacy \\n2-37. Insurgent efforts can damage or destroy both r eal and perceived economic  and political targets. \\nThe loss of government services, ove rreaction by government forces, or  the belief that the government \\nis powerless against the insurgency contributes to the population’s dissatisfaction with the government. \\nLessening Government Control \\n2-38.

This can create the perception that the insurgency is increasing its control or the \\ngovernment is losing control and legitimacy. \\nProviding Psychological Victories \\n2-39. The guerrilla seeks to gain small psychological victories. These victories do not need to be \\nsignificant in terms of material damage to the government or its armed forces. These tactical victories show \\nthat a small guerrilla force can defeat the much larger government force. \\nTying Up or Blocking Host Nation Government Resources \\n2-40. By forcing the HN government to  expend resources on military ope rations against guerrillas, the \\ninsurgency seeks to tie up resources that could best  be used by the government to provide services \\nand development programs to the populace. \\nWeakening Host Nation Government Resolve \\n2-41. By defeating small elements of the HN’s security forces and attacking government agencies, the \\nguerrilla weakens the resolve of government employees and forces. Small government forces and agencies \\nbecome aware of their vulnerability. Desertion, ab sence from work, willingness to  compromise, difficulty \\nin recruiting, or limitations on services to dangerous areas all benefit the insurgency’s purpose. \\nIntimidating the Population \\n2-42.

Guerrillas seek to acquire government weapons, uniforms, equipment, supplies, or vehicles. \\nInfiltrating Host Nation Government and Government Forces \\n2-44. Insurgents will often attempt to infiltrate various government minist ries and security forces by \\nemplacing sympathizers and by converting existing members of those agencies. These infiltrators are used \\nto gather intelligence and to subvert operations. \\nCausing COIN Security Force Overreaction \\n2-45. Since a COIN fight is the fight for the population, often the intent of insurgents using terrorism \\nor guerrilla warfare is to cause a heavy-handed respons e to attacks on the part of the COIN force or HN \\nsecurity force.

Insurgents often use their ideology to show the population how they can address the root causes \\nthat the government cannot provide or is not providing. Insurgent ideology attempts to provide a vision \\nof how a society, including a political and economic system, should be st ructured.

Resource support is typically guerrillas, money, weapons, equipment, food, advisors, and training. \\nResource support is often the most important form of support, such as, during the French experience \\nin Algeria.

Sanctuary support is a secure site to train, obtain sustainment, rest and refit. Historically, \\nsanctuaries provided insurgents a place to rebuild and reorganize without fear of Host Nation \\nor counterinsurgent interference. Often these were in neighboring countries or remote areas difficult \\nto access. Sanctuaries may also in clude areas within a state, incl uding neighborhoods where HN security \\nforces cannot or will not conduct operations. The mean ing of the term sanctuary is evolving. Today, \\ninsurgents can draw on “virtual” sanctuaries in the Internet, global financial systems, and the international \\nmedia. These virtual sanctuaries can be used to present insurgent actions as acceptable activities worthy of \\ninternal and external support. Effective COIN operations work to eliminate all sanctuaries. \\nINTERNAL SUPPORT \\n2-59. Internal support is any support provided from inside the country.

The cadre often gives credit to the insurgent \\nmovement for all local successes and blames government forces for all failures and problems. Every \\npromise and appeal made by cadre members is associ ated with tangible soluti ons and deeds. Competent \\ninsurgents and counterinsurgents both seek to mob ilize and sustain popular suppor t for their cause while \\ndiscouraging popular support for their adversaries. There are five common methods, used individually or \\nin various combinations, to mobilize popular support. Knowing these five means provides an opportunity \\nfor the counterinsurgent to identify when they are being used and then counter them. The five common \\nmethods are— \\nPersuasion \\n2-65.

In counterinsurgencies, there are two general types of insurgent bases: safe houses and guerrilla \\nbase camps.

More sophisticated  guerrilla base camps have command \\nposts, training areas, communications facilities, medical stations, and sustainment centers. These base \\ncamps, however, are not the same as conventional bases. They are usually small in overall scope, spread \\nout, and sometimes underground. Insurgents try to locate base camps within insurgent-controlled areas \\nwhere cover and concealment provide security against detection.

Insurgencies often progress through three phases in their efforts.

However, what makes up each phase remains nearly identical. \\nPhase I—Latent and Incipient \\n2-81. The first phase of an insurgency tends to begin with the government having stronger forces than \\nthe insurgents do. As a result, insurgents often must concentrate on survival and building support. \\nInsurgent efforts may include— \\n• Establishing and expanding the organization \\n• Spreading its ideology through information operations \\n• Starting or supporting antigovernment activity such as demonstrations and strikes \\n• Raising funds through illegal taxation and crime \\n• Organizing small, local guerrilla forces that conduct small-scale intermittent operations'),\n",

The second phase of an insurgency starts wh en force correlations approach equilibrium \\nand guerrilla warfare becomes the most important, pervasive activity. Insurgent efforts may include— \\n• Increased scale of guerrilla attacks; attempt to force government forces into the defense. \\n• Increased use of sabotage and terrorism. \\n• Intensified propaganda. \\n• Attempts to gain control of isolated geographic areas and develop bases for further operations. \\n• Government officials are being driven out of areas with strong insurgent support. \\n• Establishment of local shadow governments. \\n• Increased efforts to gain international recognition and support.'),\n",

The third phase of an insurgency normally begins  when insurgents believe they have superior \\nstrength and their military forces attempt conventi onal operations to destroy the government’s military \\ncapability. Insurgent efforts may include— \\n• Combining guerrilla forces and training them to fight as conventional forces. Over time, these \\nconventional forces form multiple echelons. Th ese forces confront the counterinsurgents \\nin conventional battle. \\n• Acquiring more powerful and sophisticated weapons through foreign assistance or capture. \\n• Obtaining support from external combat forces, such as special or conventional forces. \\n• Expanding areas of insurgent control and increasing political activity. \\n \\n2-84. Not all insurgencies progress through all three phases, and linear progression through all three \\nphases is certainly not a requirement for success.  Insurgent success can o ccur in any phase. Also, \\ninsurgencies can revert to an earlier phase and re sume development when favorable conditions return. \\nInsurgent success can occur in any phase. \\n2-85.

Advanced insurgencies can rapidly shift, split,  combine, or reorganize—they are dynamic \\nand adaptive.  \\nORGANIZATIONAL AND OPERATIONAL PATTERNS \\n2-86. Insurgencies develop organizational and operational patterns from the interaction of many factors. \\nAlthough each insurgency organization is unique, there are often similarities among them and knowing the \\ncommonly accepted general patterns or strategies of  insurgency helps in predicting the tactics \\nand techniques they may employ against the governme nt. Other considerations include the operational \\nenvironment, level of success of the insurgency, and the length of time an insurgency has been operating. \\nA counterinsurgent must learn about the insurgency and adapt to it based off its operational \\norganizational patterns. \\n2-87.

This sets the \\ntone for how they operate and how they fight \\nSection IV—STRATEGIES \\nEven if modern insurgencies use more  than one doctrinal model or theory for their strategy, aspects of these \\nstrategies and recognizable characteristics do exist. The six common insurgent strategies are urban, \\nmilitary-focused, protracted popular war, identity-focused, conspiratorial, and composite and coalition. At the \\ntactical level, a counterinsurgent will deal usually only with the urban, military-focused, and protracted popular \\nwar strategies. These insurgent strategies provide a co mmon frame of reference for the counterinsurgent. The \\nsavvy counterinsurgent can identify if an insurgency is using one or a combination of the strategies. Knowing \\nwhat strategy the insurgents are using facilitates the anticipation of insurgent courses of action (COAs).'),\n",

In the urban strategy, the insurgents attack government targets with the intention of causing \\ngovernment forces to overreact agai nst the population. The insurgents want the government’s repressive \\nmeasures to enrage the people so they will rise up,  support the insurgency and overthrow the government. \\nThis strategy can be initiated without popular s upport. Its success relies almost exclusively on a \\nspontaneous uprising sparked by rage at government oppression. However, an insurgency occurring in an \\nurban area does not necessarily mean that it uses th e urban strategy. On November 1, 1954, the National \\nLiberation Front in Algeria used a form of the urba n strategy when they launched a series of bombings \\nand attacks, causing significant civilian casualties, in order to shock the French into negotiations. The \\nurban strategy actions are often predictable and possess these characteristics— \\n• Insurgents often use terrorist attacks, which they hope are highly visible and produce high \\ncasualties. Their true intention may not necessarily be to cause fear or terror, but to provoke the \\ngovernment into overreaction. \\n• Insurgent propaganda tends to focus on government  brutality, calling attention to specific harsh \\ngovernment actions such as massacres, tort ure of political prisoners, disappearances \\nof individuals, and brutal responses to peaceful demonstrations.'),\n",

The military-focused strategy believes that m ilitary action can create the conditions needed \\nfor success. Military-focused insurgen ts often believe that a small group of guerrillas operating in an area \\nwhere grievances exist can  eventually gather enough support to ach ieve their aims. The success of this \\nsmall group depends upon successful military action a nd popular uprising. The most iconic examples \\nof military-focused strategy are Che Guevara a nd Fidel Castro; both proposed attacks on military \\nand government targets until they ga thered the support necessary to se ize power.

The protracted popular war strategy is based on Mao Zedong’s theory of protracted popular war. \\nThis strategy is broken down into three distinct phases—latent or incipient, guerrilla warfare, and war \\nof movement. Each phase builds upon the previous phase, and continues activities from the previous \\nphases. The protracted popular war strategy has both a political wing a nd a military wing. This strategy \\nrequires a high level of organiza tion and indoctrination, actions along multiple lines of effort, \\nand leadership to direct the shifting of phases according to circumst ances. In all the variations of this \\nstrategy, certain characteristics tend to stand out, such as— \\n• Continuous, long-term efforts to build popular support, inf iltrate legitimate government \\norganizations, and establish and maintain a clandestine organization. \\n• Highly-indoctrinated leadership, political cadre, and guerrilla fighters.'),\n",

The identity-focused strategy mobilizes suppor t based on the common identity of religious \\naffiliation, clan, tribe, or ethnic group. In this st rategy, legitimacy and popular support are tied to their \\nidentity and, often, no effort is made to garner popular support outside their identity. Rather, communities \\noften join the insurgent movement as a whole, bringing with them their existing social or military \\nhierarchy. External support is garnered from international elements of the same identity. In Sri Lanka, the \\nTamil Tigers have fought an insurgency against the gove rnment for decades in order to establish an ethnic \\nTamil state and, at times, have received support from India. Contemporary characteristics of the \\nidentity-focused strategy include— \\n• Attacks on those who threaten the traditions and social structure of the identity. \\n• Little or no need to establish a shadow government; already established. \\n• Protects what it considers the interest of the identity. \\n• Willingness to use tactics of other strategies.'),\n",

The conspiratorial strategy attempts to subvert  the government from within and often involves a \\nfew leaders and a militant cadre. Although subversiv e activities may take place in other strategies, \\nparticularly in the protracted popular war or urban strate gies, conspiratorial strategies often attempt to have \\nits illegal political party become a legitimate political party, enter th e government legitimately and then \\ntake control of the government. Insurgents using the conspiratorial strategy do not intend to integrate into \\nthe national government, but to overthrow the government. Once the insurgency succeeds in gaining \\nlegitimate political representation, the newly legitimized politicians, who may have been previously \\ntargeted by counterinsurgents, must be re-evaluated to see if they are s till legitimate targets.

The composite and coalition strategy applies wh en different insurgent groups using different \\nstrategies combine to form loose coalitions that se rve the purposes of the different groups. However, the \\ncomposite and coalition strategy is usually united in opposition to something, for example an occupier or \\nspecific grievance, rather than for a positive objective. Within a single AO, there may be multiple \\ncompeting entities, each seeking to maximize its survivability and influence. Recently, Al—Qaeda in Iraq \\nprovides the best example of a composite and coaliti on strategy; they founded th e Islamic State of Iraq \\nand became an umbrella group for many other estab lished insurgent groups.

For example, an \\ninsurgency in Phase I, Latent and Incipient, using an urban strategy, builds sufficient strength to progress \\nto Phase II, Guerrilla Warfare. Once in Phase II, the insurgents may believe they are strong enough \\nto initiate a series of attacks.

Nonviolent tactics attempt \\nto achieve political goals without the use of force. Insurgent violent tac tics are often accompanied by a variety \\nof nonviolent tactics. Used together, these tactics, along with supporting propaganda, can assist in recruiting \\nand gathering popular support. Historically insurgencies  have fielded dedicated personnel to foment nonviolent \\naction such as strikes and protests to supplement violent action. Insurgents are by nature an asymmetric threat. \\nAsymmetric Warfare is a conflict in which a weaker opponent uses unorthodox or surprise tactics to attack \\nweak points of a stronger opponent, esp ecially if the tactics include te rrorism, guerrilla warfare, criminal \\nactivity, subversion, or propaganda. Violent tactics by insurgents can include terrorism, guerrilla warfare , \\nsabotage, or conventional operations. Insurgents often use terrorism and guerrilla tactics to achieve their goals, \\nbecause they do not have the capability to contest the government or counter insurgency forces in conventional \\noperations. \\nVIOLENT TACTICS \\n2-97.

Guerrilla harassment atte mpts to keep government forces on the defensive \\nand weaken the Host Nation, which can include destroying resources and disrupting lines \\nof communication.

Counterinsurgency is those military, paramilitary, economic, psychological and civil actions taken \\nby a government to defeat an insurgency (JP 1- 02). In a counterinsurgency, Host Nation forces \\nand partners operate to defeat ar med resistance, reduce passive opposition,  and establish or reestablish the \\nlegitimacy of the Host Nation's government (FM 3- 0). Counterinsurgency is  a proactive approach \\ninvolving all elements of national power; even down to the tactical level. COIN operations strive to achieve \\nunity of effort amongst many joint, interagency, in tergovernmental, and multinational organizations. COIN \\nincludes tactical planning; intelligence development and analysis; training; materiel, technical, \\norganizational assistance; advice; infrastructure development; tactical-level operations; and information \\nengagement.

The end state of counterinsurgen cy operations is a legitimate Ho st Nation government that can \\nprovide effective governance. This includes providing for their populace, eliminating the root causes of the \\ninsurgency and preventing those root causes from retu rning. Counterinsurgent ope rations can successfully \\ndefeat an insurgency; achie ve unity of effort along multiple lines of  effort; isolate th e insurgent from the \\npeople; and increase the legitimacy of the Host Na tion government. The five re quirements for successful \\nCOIN operations at the tactical level include:   \\n• Together, US and HN military commanders devise the plan for attacking the insurgent strategy, \\nand focus on bolstering governmental legitimacy. \\n• HN and US forces establish control of area and secure the population continuously.'),\n",

Foreign internal defense  (FID) is the participation by civilian and military agencies of a \\ngovernment in any of the action programs taken by another government or othe r designated organization \\nto free and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency (JP 3-07.1). The FID programs \\nare used to support friendly nations operating in or threatened with potential hos tilities. As a tool of US \\nforeign policy, FID is a national-level effort that involves numerous US Government agencies all working \\ntogether to eliminate the root causes of an insurgency. \\n3-4. US military involvement in FID has traditiona lly been focused towa rd counterinsurgency. \\nAlthough much of the FID effort remains focused on this important area, US FID programs may aim at \\nother threats to an HN’s internal stability, such as civil disorder, illicit drug trafficking, or terrorism.

Typical \\ntactical involvement in FID enta ils conducting combat operations ag ainst guerrillas, conducting actions \\nacross all seven lines of effort to defeat insurgency, and training Host Nation security forces. \\nINTERNAL DEFENSE AND DEVELOPMENT \\n3-5. Internal defense and development (IDAD)  is the full range of measures taken by a nation \\nto promote its growth and protect itself from subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency. It focuses on \\nbuilding viable institutions (political, economic, social, and military) that respond to the need of the society \\n(FM 1-02). IDAD is not only a singl e master plan, it is a compilation of all internal defense \\nand development plans at the strategic, operational,  and tactical level that a nation possesses.

When working with interagency, intergovern mental, nongovernmental a nd multinational groups, \\nArmy commanders have inherent responsibilities that include clarifying the military’s mission; determining \\ncontrolling legal and policy authorities; and sustaining and caring for these organizations and individuals. \\nInformation sharing between the elements is essential to establish ground truth.

The military’s contribution is vital for COIN efforts. Demanding and complex, COIN draws \\nheavily on a broad range of the force’s capabilities and requires a different mix of offensive, defensive, \\nand stability operations from that expected in major combat operations. Air, land, and maritime \\ncomponents all contribute to successful operations and to the vital effort  to separate insurgents from the \\npeople. The Army and Marine Corps usually furnish the principal US military contributions to COIN \\nforces. \\n3-15.

An intergovernmental organization is an organization created by  a formal agreement, for \\nexample, a treaty, between two or more governments. It may be established on a global, regional, \\nor functional basis for wide-ranging or narrowly defined purposes. IGOs are formed to protect and promote \\nnational interests shared by member states (JP 1-02). The most notable IGO is the United Nations. \\nDepending on the situation and HN needs, tactical units can expect to encounter any number of UN \\norganizations in their AOs, such as the following: \\n• Department of Peacekeeping Operations. \\n• World Food Program. \\n• UN Refugee Agency (the UN High Commissioner for Refugees). \\n• UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. \\nNONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS \\n3-19.

Typical NGOs that tactical units may encounter include— \\n• Médecins sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders). \\n• Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE). \\n• Oxford Committee for Famine Relief (OXFAM). \\n• Save the Children. \\nINDIGENOUS POPULATION AND INSTITUTIONS \\n3-20. IPI is the civilian construct of an area of operati ons to include its population, governmental, tribal, \\ncommercial, and private organizations and entities. Th e population includes legal citizens, legal and illegal \\nimmigrants, and all categories of disl ocated civilians. As stated earlier,  this is the most important group \\nfor counterinsurgent units to protect, engage, and synchronize actions. \\nMULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND CONTRACTORS \\n3-21. Multinational corporations often engage in r econstruction, economic development, security \\nand governance activities.

Commanders at all \\nlevels will have to overcome many challenges and work to integrate all the agencies organizations present \\nin the AO, so that everyone works towards a common end state. \\n3-23. Challenges to the integration of military and civilian agencies include different organizational \\ncultures, capabilities and structures. Some civilian organizations may not be trained and equipped \\nto operate in austere, unsecured environments or they may not be able to sustain themselves in remote \\nareas. Some organizations may be averse to assuming risk, which may hinder the overall COIN effort. \\nMilitary and governmental organiza tions are heavily dependent on es tablishing and implementing their \\ninternal operating procedures and they are often reluctant to adapt or change those procedures \\nto accommodate the addition of new actors.

FM 3-0 states that Army forces conduct full-spectrum operations outside the United States by \\nexecuting offensive, defensive, and stability operations as part of integrated joint, interagency, \\nand multinational teams. Full spectrum operations entail simultaneous and continuous combinations \\nof offensive, defensive, and stability or civ il support operations.

The \\ntransient nature and size of urban populations increasingly hinder a counterinsurg ent’s ability to detect \\nand identify insurgents. In surgents use urban centers for freedom of movement, easy access to their mass \\nbase and proximity to targets. Popul ar support at the outset of this kind of insurgency is not necessary, but \\ncan be gained through intimidation and attacking ba sic services provided by the government.

The organization for, and conduct of, counter insurgency operations depends on the mission \\nvariables and the OE. However, COIN ope rations place a premium on boots on the ground. Task \\norganization is the temporary grouping of forces designe d to accomplish a particular mission (FM 3-0). \\nTask organization for counterinsurgency operations is often substantially different from how units are task \\norganized in conventional operations.

A means to maxi mize the employment of all assets is referred to \\nas troops-to-task analysis. This process enables units to correctly assign tasks to units of appropriate size \\nand capabilities. \\n3-87. Often conducted during MDMP, staffs and tactical units begin troops-to-task analysis by \\ndetermining a standard size element to use as a baseline (Infantry platoon, Armor platoon, Cavalry platoon, \\ncompany, or others). The staff determines the forces available (often including HN security forces). Then, \\nthe staff or tactical unit lists and prioritizes each task and determines the forces required to accomplish each \\ntask using the baseline unit as a measure,. Finally, the tactical unit and staff uses the commander’s planning \\nguidance to array forces and assign tasks. \\n3-88. Figure 3-4 shows an example format for a troops-to-task analysis worksheet.

Units achieve surprise by striking the enem y at a time, place, or manner in which he \\nis unprepared. Total surprise is rarely attainable or essential in conventional operations but is often \\nessential during COIN operations. \\nCONCENTRATION \\n5-4. This is the massing of combat power, particularly its  effects, at the decisive point to achieve the \\nunit’s purpose. During COIN, insurgents avoid situations in which US/HN security forces could potentially \\nmass combat power unless the potential collateral effects of use of that combat power will distance the \\npopulation from the US/HN government.

Key factors to consider in selecting the method to use include the enemy threat, the local populace \\nsupport, the level of intelligence ava ilable, and the capabilities of the HN security forces. In both methods, \\nthe cordon is still established with as  much speed or surprise as possi ble to isolate the objective. Both \\nmethods may require some integrated HN security forces  or civil authorities to obtain the agreement by the \\noccupants of the targeted search area.

A second version of the cordon and knock is cordon and ask, which means occupants or the local \\nHost Nation authorities are asked for permission to search a particular location.

However, the cordon and knock and the cordon and ask require some degree of integration \\nwith HN security force or HN authorities to obtain the agreement by the occupants of the target to the \\nsubsequent search.

Units should plan movement \\nto the ORP, from the ORP to the ambush site and back and withdrawal from the ambush site is back to the \\nORP or to another final destination. In addition, leaders should plan movement that allows the unit to enter \\nthe ambush site from the rear and avoid moving into the kill zone or across the suspected route of the \\nenemy force to be ambushed. In COIN, the presence of people near the ambush positions requires a \\ncarefully planned movement. Units should use maps, imagery, video, HUMINT, and aerial photographs \\nto analyze the terrain and HN population. If possi ble, units conduct ground reconnaissance and avoid \\nselecting obvious ambush sites. Surprise is even more difficult to achieve in these areas.

Elements are positioned so their fields of fire overlap. \\nMortars may be positioned inside the triangle. When deployed in this manner, the triangle ambush becomes \\na small unit strongpoint that is used to interdict night movement through open areas when insurgent \\nstrategy is likely to be from any direction. Advantages include ease of control, all-round security,'),\n",

A variation of the area ambush is the “baited trap” ambush. A central kill zone is established along \\nthe insurgent’s avenue of approach. Point ambushes are established along the routes over which units \\nsupporting or reinforcing the insurgent force will have to approach.

All \\npatrols conduct rehearsals and a patrol brief at a minimum. \\nEnemy \\n5-185. Small-unit patrols are more effective than larger unit patrols against insurgent activities. This is \\nbecause they can cover more territory  than a large unit, and are more di fficult to track and predict. This \\nkeeps the insurgent off balance. \\nTerrain and Weather \\n5-186.

The \\npopulation may interact with the patrol in many ways, such as asking for medical attention \\nor demonstrating against the presence of the patrol itself. Basic urban patrolling consideration include— \\n• While contact with insurgents may happen, contact with elements of the population is certain. \\n• If available, armored vehicles should be ready to rapidly reinforce urban patrols to provide \\nadditional firepower. \\n• At least one Soldier in each squad or team should be dedicated to scanning the rooftops \\nand upper level windows. \\n• Actions at a halt must include 360-degree secur ity. Soldiers should seek cover and face out. \\nCover in an urban environment may be a light pole, a building corner or even a parked car. \\n• Urban patrols should thoroughly scan  the far side of all open ar eas, since insurgents will use \\nthem to achieve stand-off. \\n• If contact is likely, then the patrol should move by bounds.

This type of patrol collects in formation and confirms or dispr oves the accuracy of information \\npreviously received.

Reconnaissance pa trols provide the commander with \\ntimely, accurate information of in surgents, the population, and the te rrain. This information is vital \\nin making tactical decisions. Leaders must ensure that no pattern is established that would allow an \\ninsurgent force to ambush reconnaissance units.

In counterinsurgency operations, the term security patrol has often been used; however, this is still \\na combat patrol. A combat patrol provides security and harasses, destroys, or captures enemy troops, \\nequipment, and installations. A combat patrol also collects and reports information, whether related to its \\nmission or not. Combat patrols in a counterinsurgency include raids, ambushes, security, saturation, \\nand satellite patrols.

The difference between a security patrol and a raid or ambush patrol is that combat activity is not \\nthe primary mission of the security patrol. This is tr ue even if combat is expected during the patrol. \\nSecurity patrols normally seek to control critical roads and trails, maintain contact between villages \\nand units, provide security for friendly forces, provide security in rural areas, and interdict insurgent routes \\nof supply and communication. \\nSaturation Patrols \\n5-210. This is when units use numerous combat patrols to  saturate an area of suspected insurgent activity \\nby moving over planned and coordinated routes, wh ich are changed frequently to avoid establishing \\npatterns. Saturation patrols are extremely effective against insurgents. Use of saturation patrols results in \\nthe following: \\n• Denial of an area to an insurgent force as it seeks to avoid contact with the saturation patrols. \\n• Ability to harass insurgent forces. \\n• Opportunity to discover insurgent forces. \\n• Chance to gain an intimate knowledge of the area of operations. \\n• Chance to reassure the local population that the government provides protection and security. \\nSatellite Patrols \\n5-211.

The satellite patrol uses a base unit to control smaller units, or satellites, that leave and return to \\nthe base unit. The advantage of this technique is th e unpredictability, to the enem y, of the route, size, \\nlocations, and the patrol’s overall axis of advance. Satellite patrols are given either an area or an axis \\nof movement. As with all other patrols, they should have a specific task and purpose.

Additionally, the insurgents will \\nchoose targets with an eye towards re ducing the legitimacy of the established \\ngovernment. The conduct of defensive operations in COIN is very much like that in a \\nconventional defense.

This type of defensive operation concentrates  on denying enemy forces access to designated \\nterrain for a specific time rather than destroying the enemy outright (FM 3-0). In counterinsurgencies, both \\nthe insurgency and the counterinsurgent are vying for the support of the population as if it were terrain. \\nThe focus of the area defense is on retaining terrain where the bulk of the defending force positions itself \\nin mutually supporting, prepared positions. In counterinsurgencies, commanders choose an area defense \\nto secure the population by living among the population employing the seven COIN lines of effort. \\nExamples of an area defense in counterinsurgencies are a combat outpost next to a city market, a \\npermanent squad position at an electrical plant, and a checkpoint near a police station. \\nMOBILE DEFENSE \\n6-2.

In COIN operations, especially clear-hold-build operations, the most common method \\nthat tactical units employ to secure the population is the establishment of bases. Units use site selection \\ntechniques to decide where to put bases and focus security. Certain defensive actions like counter—ambush, \\ncounter—IED, and counter—sniper clearly contribute to increased civil security or increased civil control \\nas they reduce violence against HN and US forces, as well as the HN population. Throughout, units must use \\nappropriate protection measures. \\nSITE SELECTION \\n6-6. Brigades, battalions, and companies routinely possess enormous AOs during counterinsurgencies, \\nsome as large as US states.

Control is the key to a successful base defe nse. To achieve the necessary control, a \\ncommunication capability must be established between the base defense operations center and sector \\ncommanders, and between the sector commander and his bunkers, towers, and reserve. Bunkers or Towers \\nwithin each section can communicate laterally within the sector, and flank bunkers of one sector can \\ncommunicate with flank bunkers of adjacent sectors. \\nSUSTAINMENT \\n6-40. Depending on the mission and status of the battalion, the type of transport available, the weather, \\nand the terrain, resupply may be by air or ground.  The availability of landing zones and drop zones \\nprotected from the enemy's observation and fire is the main consideration if selecting organizing aerial \\nresupply. \\nPROTECTION \\n6-41. All units in the base area are responsible for preserving its fighting potential. Protective measures \\nreduce the probability (and the effects) of damage caused by hostile action. Responsibility for the conduct \\nof protective measures is assigned to fire fighting units, chemical units, medical units, and other units. \\nIn addition, all units assigned to the base are tasked to conduct activities such as dispersion, camouflage, \\nblackout, field discipline, and use of shelters.\"),\n",

Early warning of pending actions ensures the base commander time to react to  any insurgent \\nthreat. Outposts, patrols, ground surveillance and c ountermortar radar, milita ry working dogs teams, \\nand air reconnaissance and surve illance provide early warning. In formation provided by civilians \\nand actions of indigenous personnel near the base are excellent indicators of pending enemy actions. \\nAll-round security is essential. \\nDEFENSE IN DEPTH \\n6-43.

Defending forces are positioned to ensure mutual em ployment of defensive resources that include \\nfires, observation, and maneuver elements. Mutual support between defensive elements requires careful \\nplanning, positioning, and c oordination because of the circular asp ects of the base area. Surveillance, \\nobstacles, prearranged fires, and maneuvers are used to control gaps. \\nALL-AROUND DEFENSE \\n6-47. In defensive planning, the base commander must be prepared to defend against enemy attack from \\nany direction.

Types of snipers. \\nCONSIDERATIONS DURING COUNTERINSURGENCIES \\n6-92. Sniper operations have the same effect in insurg encies as they do in conventional warfare, but the \\npurpose is different. For example, in conventional wa rfare, a sniper targets leaders in order to cause \\nconfusion on the battlefield and disrupt operations. In an insurgency, a sniper will still target leaders, but \\nmore for use in propaganda that can be used after a successful attack. Add itionally, he can create the \\nattitude that the area of his operations is not secure  and the Host Nation govern ment is powerless to stop \\nhim. Since the sniper has the in itiative, leaders must enforce compliance with  the countermeasures. \\nImplementing countermeasures halfheartedly invite s casualties from snipers who can wait hours for the \\nmoment when a unit’s guard is down. US forces have two categories of sniper countermeasures: active \\ncountermeasures and passive countermeasures. Each has its place, depending on the METT-TC mission \\nvariables. \\nActive Countermeasures \\n6-93.

Observation posts should have access to powerful spotting telescopes, medium power binoculars, \\nnight observation devices (thermal, if possible), and remote control closed circuit cameras. Additionally, \\nlaser countermeasure should be employ ed, such as laser protective glasse s, binoculars with laser filters, \\nand indirect-view optics to protect observers. Additionally, many electronic detection devices are available \\nto aid in the detection of snipers such as acoustic devices. Once detected , snipers can then be neutralized \\nor forced to withdraw. Observers can maintain a constant surveillance over potential sniper positions \\nand detect snipers as they attempt to move into position for a shot. Constantly scanning an area for the \\nminute movements made by a well-trained sniper is exhausting. Therefore, personnel on static OP duty \\nshould rotate frequently.

Constant reconnaissance and security patrols around a unit’s position hinder a sniper from getting \\ninto a firing position undetected. Small patrols are usually more effective than large ones.

Small night reconnaissance patrols using night vision devices can be very effective \\nin disrupting and interdicting a sn iper. Reconnaissance patrols should move by covered and concealed \\nroutes to good observation poi nts; should stop and observe; and then should move to another position. The \\npatrol routes and times must vary, and a reaction for ce or supporting weapons must be ready if the patrol \\nmakes contact. A variation of the ambush patrol is the stay-behind ambush. A small ambush element \\nmoves as part of a larger patrol and occupies its position without being observed. It then observes its kill \\nzone, which may be very large if the element has a snip er team with it, and enga ges enemy snipers as they \\nattempt to move into position.

US sniper teams can be a very effective counter to enemy snipers.

Their precision fires are also \\nmuch less likely to cause civilian casualties than dozens of rounds from other weapons. \\nReturn Fire and Maneuver \\n6-97. Before a unit encounters an enemy sniper, the unit must not only understand the rules \\nof engagement but also war-game the rules of engageme nt to ensure the authorized level of responses are \\nsufficient. Although the ROE and the tactical situation determine the response, ideally authorization should \\ninclude the ability to respond with fire from all the units light weapons. If a unit can determine the general \\nlocation of a sniper, it should return suppressive fire  while maneuvering to engage the sniper from close \\nrange.

Allowing the enemy sniper to fi ght another day is mission failure. \\nFirst, the unit must find the sniper or the sniper team. Techniques for detecting a sniper consist \\nof identifying likely sniper locations, focusing observation on sniper movement, and seeking audible and \\nvisual signs. Backtracking, which involves integrating the following techniques, is used to find the sniper: \\nIdentify Likely Sniper Locations \\n6-107. A sniper is a line-of-sight asset. The larger the sniper kill zone, the closer or the higher he must \\nposition himself to cover it. Smaller sniper kill zones create for a narrow, if not linear, line of sight. In such \\ncases, the sniper will always choose a position that offers that offers a line of sight, such as a road or alley,'),\n",

In such \\ncases, the sniper will always choose a position that offers that offers a line of sight, such as a road or alley, \\nor maybe inside a building, shooting through a window, doorway, or other opening. \\nFocus Observation on Sniper Movement \\n6-108. Snipers always plan infiltration and exfiltration routes. After identifying possible sniper locations, \\na unit commander can focus observation on these routes and deny a sniper the ability to reposition. Snipers \\noperate slowly, with calculated movements, to avoid detection. The movement the sniper makes may not \\nbe easily detected. Units should look for movement that does not \"fit\" the environment. \\nSeek Audible/Visible Signs \\n6-109. Audible/visual indicators help find snipers based on the sniper\\'s firing a shot. Actually, firing a \\nweapon is a sniper’s greatest moment of risk; it offers the best opportunity to locate him or his team. The \\nacoustic, light and heat signatures associated with the projection of the bullet from his rifle are his greatest \\nvulnerabilities. The muzzle flash can be detected with infrared sensors out to a kilometer. Often the muzzle \\nflash and the blast can throw dust into the air.

Acoustic sensors can detect a muzzle blast from several \\nhundred meters to more than a kilometer. The bullet’s shock wave is a mini-sonic boom.

In a city, the backtracking proce ss is complicated by buildings that obstruct the view of the \\nsniper’s position. Backtracking is challenging, but it is how you relate shot angles, kill zones, movement, \\nand audible and visible signs to help you find the sniper. Experience and training play a major role \\nin accurate backtracking. \\nEliminate Sniper \\n6-111. Once spotted, the enemy sniper mu st be killed or forced to surre nder.

Figure out his kill zone and stay out of it. A unit may also want to eliminate or at least reduce his \\ntargets. If a unit removes its targets, the unit curtails mission success; the sniper will need to move, or at \\nleast adjust his position, to remain effective. \\nManeuver Rapidly \\n6-113. When contact is made, the on-scene commander needs to rapidly calculate the disposition of his \\nforces, the quick reaction force (QRF ), and adjacent friendly forces and factor in time/space considerations \\nto determine how to neutralize the thr eat.

An example is the local \\nsecurity of a key judge who has been instrumental  in issuing verdicts ag ainst criminal activities \\nof insurgents in order to prevent his assassination.

Because they begin to address the root \\ncauses that lead to the insurgency, stability operations ar e often the most critical for defeating an insurgency. \\nThere are five primary tasks within stability operations— establish civil security, establish civil control, support \\nto governance, restore essential services , and support to economic and infrastru cture development . Two \\nadditional tasks— support Host Nation security forces  and conduct information engagement  are added \\nto produce the seven COIN lines of effort. HN security forces are discussed in Chapter 8, while information \\nengagements are in Chapter 4.

The stability tasks and their interrelation with the COIN LOEs are not sequential in nature. \\nThey must be continually assessed and re-evaluated. This iterative pr ocess occurs because units do not \\nhave the manpower to apply the same effort along each stability task.

In a counterinsurgency, situations may arise that require counterinsurgency personnel to negotiate, \\nmediate, and perhaps arbitrate disputes.

In the joint, combined, and interagency environment, negotiations and mediations can be \\ncomplex.

Counterinsurgents may need to influence the existing HN approach to leadership.

In some cases, commanders will need to replace some  HN leaders before their \\nunits will become functional. While every situation is different, leaders of the development program should \\nassess and measure the following HN security force factors throughout planning, preparation, \\nand execution of the operation: \\n• Social structure, organization, demographi cs, interrelationships, and education levels \\nof security force elements. \\n• Extent of acceptance of ethnic and religious minorities. \\n• Laws and regulations governing the security forces and their relationship to national leaders. \\n• Corruption, abuse of power, and nepotism. \\n• Equipment and facilities, with a priority placed on maintenance.'),\n",

HN security forces need infrastructure support. So ldiers and police need buildings for storage, \\ntraining, and shelter. Often, re quirements include barracks, ranges,  motor pools, and other military \\nfacilities. Construction takes time; the Host Nation needs to  invest early in such facilities if they are to be \\navailable when needed. Protection must be considered  in any infrastructure design, including headquarters \\nfacilities, since infrastructure is an attractive target fo r insurgents.

A primary goal of any IPB is to accurately predict the threat’s likely COA (step four—which may \\ninclude political, social, religious, informational, economic, and military  actions). Commanders can then \\ndevelop their own COAs that maximize and apply combat power at decisive points.

Countering them will demand every ounce of your intellect. But be comforted: You are not the \\nfirst to feel this way. There are tactical fundamentals you can apply to link the theory with the techniques \\nand procedures you already know. \\nWHAT IS COUNTERINSURGENCY? \\nC-4. If you have not studied c ounterinsurgency theory, here it is in  a nutshell: Counterinsurgency is a \\ncompetition with the insurg ent for the right to win the hearts, minds, and acquiescence of the population. \\nYou are being sent in because the in surgents, at their strongest, can def eat anything with less strength than \\nyou. But you have more combat power than you can or should use in most situations. Injudicious use \\nof firepower creates blood feuds, homeless people, and societal disruption that fuel and perpetuate the \\ninsurgency. The most beneficial actions are often local politics, civic action, and beat-cop behaviors.

Time is short during predeployment, but you will never have more time to think than you have \\nnow. This is your chance to prepare yourself and your command. \\n1. Know your turf. Know the people, the topography, economy, history, religion, and culture. \\nKnow every village, road, field, population group, tribal leader, and anci ent grievance. Your \\ntask is to become the world expert on your district. If you don’t know precisely where you \\nwill be operating, study the general area. Read the map like a book: Study it every night \\nbefore sleep and redraw it from memory ev ery morning until you understand its patterns \\nintuitively. Develop a mental model of your area, a framework in which to fit every new \\npiece of knowledge you acquire. Study handover notes from predecessors; better still, get \\nin touch with the unit in theater and pick their leaders’ brains. In an ideal world, intelligence \\nofficers and area experts would brief you; however, this rarely happens, and even if it does, \\nthere is no substitute for personal mastery. Understand the broader area of influence, which \\ncan be a wide area, particularly when insurgents draw on global grievances. Share out aspects \\nof the operational area among platoon leader s and noncommissioned officers; have each \\nindividual develop a personal specialization a nd brief the others. Neglect this knowledge, \\nand it will kill you.'),\n",

Neglect this knowledge, \\nand it will kill you. \\n2. Diagnose the problem. Once you know your area and its people, you can begin to diagnose \\nthe problem. Who are the insurgents? What dr ives them? What makes local leaders tick? \\nCounterinsurgency is fundamentally a comp etition between each side to mobilize the \\npopulation in support of its agenda. So you must understand what motivates the people \\nand how to mobilize them. You need to know why and how the insurgents are getting \\nfollowers. This means you need to know your real enemy, not a cardboard cut-out. The \\nenemy is adaptive, resourceful, and probably grew up in the region where you will be \\noperating. The locals have known him since he was a boy; how long have they known you? \\nYour worst opponent is not the psychopathic terrorist of Hollywood; it is the charismatic \\nfollow-me warrior who would make your best platoon leader. His followers are not misled \\nor naïve; much of his success may be due to bad government policies or security forces that \\nalienate the population. Work this problem collectively with your platoon and squad leaders. \\nDiscuss ideas, explore the problem, understand what you are facing, and seek a consensus. If'),\n",

If \\nthis sounds unmilitary, get over it. Once you are in theater, situations will arise too quickly \\nfor orders or even commander’s intent. Corporals and privates will have to make snap \\njudgments with strategic impact. The only way to help them is to give them a shared \\nunderstanding, then trust them to think for themselves on the day. \\n3. Organize for intelligence. In counterinsurgency, killing th e enemy is easy. Finding him \\nis often nearly impossible. Intelligence and operations are complementary. Your operations \\nwill be intelligence-driven, but intelligence will come mostly from your own operations, not \\nas a product prepared and served up by higher headquarters. So you must organize \\nfor intelligence. You will need a company S2 and an intelligence section (including analysts). \\nYou might need platoon S2s and S3s, and you will need a r econnaissance and surveillance \\n(R&S) element. You will not have enough lingui sts—you never do—but carefully consider \\nwhere best to use them.

Put the smartest soldiers in \\nthe S2 section and the R&S squad. You will have one less rifle squad, but the intelligence \\nsection will pay for itself in lives and effort saved. \\n4. Organize for interagency operations. Almost everything in counterinsurgency \\nis interagency. And everything important, from policing to intelligence to civil-military \\noperations to trash collection, will involve your company working with civilian actors \\nand local indigenous part ners you cannot control,  but whose success is essential for yours. \\nTrain the company in interagency operations: Get a briefing from the US Department'),\n",

Train point-men in each squad \\nto deal with the interagency people. Realize that civilians find rifles, helmets, and body armor \\nintimidating. Learn how not to scare them. Ask others who come from that country or culture \\nabout your ideas. See it through the eyes of a civilian who knows nothing about the military. \\nHow would you react if foreigners came to  your neighborhood and c onducted the operations \\nyou planned? What if somebody came to your mother’s house and did that? Most \\nimportantly, know that your operations will create a temporary breathing space, but long-term \\ndevelopment and stabilization by civilian agencies will ultimately win the war. \\n5. Travel light and harden your co mbat service support (CSS). You will be weighed down \\nwith body armor, rations, extra ammunition,  communications gear, and a thousand other \\nthings. The enemy will carry a rifle or rocket-propelled grenade launcher, a shemagh (head \\nscarf), and a water bottle if he is lucky. Unless you ruthlessly lighten y our load and enforce a \\nculture of speed and mobility, the insurgents will consistently out-run and out-maneuver you. \\nBut in lightening your load, make sure you can always reach  back to call for firepower \\nor heavy support if needed.

Most attacks on Coalition forces in Iraq in 2004 and 2005, outside preplanned \\ncombat actions like the two battles of Fallujah or Operation Iron Horse, were against CSS \\ninstallations and convoys. You do the math. Ensure your CSS assets are hardened, have \\ncommunications, and are trained in combat operations. They may do more fighting than your \\nrifle squads. \\n6. Find a political/cultural adviser. In a force optimized for counterinsurgency, you might \\nreceive a political-cultural adviser at company level, a diplomat or military foreign area \\nofficer able to speak the language and navigate the intricacies of local politics. Back on planet \\nEarth, the corps and division commander will get a political advisor; you will not, so you \\nmust improvise.
